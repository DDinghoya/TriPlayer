# TriPlayer

TriPlayer is a feature-rich audio player for the Nintendo Switch. It is able to play music in the background, including when playing games or on the HOME menu. TriPlayer requires a console capable of running Atmosphere. It gained it's name as it consists of **three** separate components, and its ability to play MP3 files.

## Requirements

* A Nintendo Switch running Atmosphere 0.10.0+
   * 0.10.0+ has more memory available to sysmodules, so older versions aren't supported
* A relatively up-to-date firmware
   * Some components require functionality that was added to later firmwares, so 10.0.0+ is currently supported
* Music!
   * Only audio files in mp3 format are supported at this time
